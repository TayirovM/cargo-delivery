# Cargo Delivery Project Documentation

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a comprehensive logistics and cargo delivery platform. The platform consists of three main components:
1. **Customer App**: Allows customers to request deliveries, track their shipments, and manage payments.
2. **Driver App**: Enables drivers to receive delivery requests, navigate to pickup and drop-off locations, and update delivery statuses.
3. **Admin Panel**: Provides administrative tools for managing deliveries, monitoring driver activity, and analyzing performance metrics.

## Features
- **Customer App**:  
  - User registration and management  
  - Real-time tracking of deliveries  
  - Notifications for order status updates  
  - Payment processing  

- **Driver App**:  
  - Driver onboarding and profile management  
  - Delivery request management  
  - Navigation assistance  
  - Status updates for ongoing deliveries  

- **Admin Panel**:  
  - Dashboard for monitoring activity  
  - Tools for managing users, drivers, and delivery requests  
  - Analytics and reporting features  

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js, Flutter
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Hosting**: AWS, or alternative cloud services
- **Payment Integration**: Stripe, or other payment gateways

## MVP Plan
The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) will focus on the essential features needed to launch the platform:
- Basic customer registration and order placement functionality in the Customer App.
- Implementation of the Driver App for receiving and managing delivery requests.
- Admin Panel for monitoring and managing deliveries without advanced analytics.

This structured approach will allow us to gather user feedback early and iteratively improve the platform based on real-world usage.
